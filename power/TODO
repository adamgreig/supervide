Schematic
* General checking
* Values: LED resistors, coil resistors, I_sense stuff, TRIAC stuff.
* I_sense stuff.
* Check TRIAC section is sane.

Footprints/pinouts
* h/s
* ac/dc
* Order of pins on inlet/outlet
* I sense
* relays
* opto triac driver
* 2x4 conncetor +pinout!
* passives
* mounting holes

PCB
* Check case-related things
* Unmask traces that need bulking.
* Clean up some traces-pad interfaces (i.e. I sense)
* Confirm via sizes, trace widths, clearances meet house standard.
* Remove IEC inlet protrusions outside board edge
* Clean/pretty up silk
* Standard checking
* Check whether earth track gets in the way of IEC inlet mounting.

Schematic
* Consider TRIAC series gate resistor
* Consider TRIAC snubber.

Footprints
* h/s
* ac/dc
* Inlet and outlet: remove protrusions
* I sense
* relays
* opto triac driver
* 2x4 conncetor
* passives
* mounting holes

Pinouts
* ac/dc
* inlet/outlet
* I_sense
* relays
* opto triac diver
* 2x4 connector

PCB
* Check case-related things
* Check whether earth track gets in the way of IEC inlet mounting.
* Clean up some traces-pad interfaces (i.e. I sense)
* Confirm via sizes, trace widths, clearances meet house standard.
* Unmask traces that need bulking.
* Clean/pretty up silk
* Standard checking

ISSUES
* Triac gate wants a fuse.

FIXES
* NPN BJTs, not PNPs, for relay driving.
* Orange LED resistor should be 300R, not 75R.
* Need 300R part number.
* Removed V_offset line.
* Changed MOC emitter resistor to 300R to reduce drive I a bit.

FIXES
* NPN BJTs, not PNPs, for relay driving.
* Orange LED resistor should be 300R, not 75R.
* Need 300R part number.
* Removed V_offset line.
* Changed MOC emitter resistor to 300R to reduce drive I a bit.

* Removed protrusions on inlet/outlet footprint silks
* Bulked up pad size on outlet (it has slightly thicker pins/holes...).
* Fixed pin labelling on ACS710
* Increased isolation on MOC part by changing pad shapes.
* Changed lots of footprints.
* Test points
* Rerouted relay drivers.

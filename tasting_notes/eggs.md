# Sous Vide Eggs

### Experiment 1: 30 March 2016

Two eggs cooked for 40 minutes at 64.0C.

First egg: Soft, with white mostly cooked through but a little runny. Yolk very 
runny with no jellying evident. Tasted very soft but not objectionable.

Second egg left for a further 20m at 66.0C. Noticably more set, with the white 
consistency improved and the yolk starting to jelly. Improved taste and 
texture. David said "not entirely objectionable" while Adam thought "tasty, 
with reservations". Suggestions for future are increased time and temperature a 
little further.
